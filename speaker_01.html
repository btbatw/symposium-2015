                    <h3>Director of the Institute of Biomedical Science Academia Sinica, Taiwan</h3>
                    <p>Dr. Chen is a world-renowned biomedical researcher specializing in genomic and translational medicine. He has published more than a hundred scientific papers in prestigious journals and received multiple awards for his remarkable research and innovation in medicine. One of his most notable works is the invention of Myozyme, the first drug approved by the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Evaluation Agency to treat Pompe disease (glycogen storage disease type II). He is currently a Distinguished Research Fellow of the Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Academia Sinica, and Professor of Pediatrics at Duke University. Dr. Chen obtained his M.D. from National Taiwan University in 1973 and has been keen on studying the human genome since then. In 1978, he completed his Ph.D. in genetics from Columbia University and became a faculty at Duke University in 1983. He continued his research at Duke until he was recruited by Nobel Laureate Yuan-Tseh Lee （李遠哲）to be the Director of the Institute of Biomedical Sciences in 2001. In the past 14 years, he has contributed tremendously to the collaboration between hospitals and research institutes and laid the groundwork for Taiwan to develop translational medicine and biotech industry. His lab has also devoted to understanding the genetic basis of adverse drug reactions and successfully identified the genes/SNPs associated with the life-threatening Steven-Johnson syndrome. Dr. Chen is also highly admired and respected for his mentorship to many students and young scientists in Taiwan. Many of them continue to thrive and become outstanding scientists in the field.</p>
