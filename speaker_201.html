                    <h2>Gene-Wei Li, Ph.D. <br>李勁葦博士</h2>
                    <h3>Assistant professor, Biology, MIT</h3>
                    <p>Gene-Wei Li received his PhD training in Physics at Harvard University, where he developed single-molecule approaches to probe the dynamics of gene expression in living cells. He then became a Helen Hay Whitney Postdoctoral Fellow at UCSF. There he combined analytical and high-throughput sequencing approaches to reveal the intricate tuning of protein synthesis in relation to a cell's physiology. He became an assistant professor of Biology at MIT in 2015. His laboratory aims to achieve quantitative understanding of how a cell works, with special emphasis on the control of gene expression and protein synthesis. Gene grew up in Hsinchu and received B.S. in Physics from National Tsinghua University.
